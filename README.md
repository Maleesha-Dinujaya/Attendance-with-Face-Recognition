# Face Recognition Attendance System

A robust, AI-powered attendance system that automates the process of attendance marking using face recognition technology. This project is built using Python, OpenCV, and face_recognition libraries, ensuring high accuracy and efficiency in identifying individuals and recording attendance.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Recognition:** Recognizes faces in real-time through a connected camera.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Automatically logs attendance and updates records in JSON and Excel files.
- **Scalable Data Management:** Stores student data, attendance records, and additional details using JSON.
- **Customizable UI:** Includes a visually appealing user interface with images and real-time data display.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: OpenCV, face_recognition, cvzone, openpyxl
- A connected camera for real-time face capture
- JSON file for student data
- Excel file for storing attendance

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/face-recognition-attendance-system.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd face-recognition-attendance-system
    ```

3. Install required Python libraries:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Ensure you have the required Excel and JSON files.

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` file to start the attendance system:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

2. The system will open a window displaying real-time camera feed. When a face is recognized, the attendance is marked automatically.

3. Check the `attendance.xlsx` file for updated attendance records.
